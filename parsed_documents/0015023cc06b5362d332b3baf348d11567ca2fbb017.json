This observation is consistent with a previous report of deletion of PK1, 473 along with the Poly-C-tract, with no adverse effect in viral replication (37). This also supports 474 our findings that the truncation of the Poly-C-tract to create the C11 construct had no effect on 475 replicon replication in the cell lines tested. As has been described with Mengo virus, it is 476 possible that the role of the poly-C-tract is essential in other aspects of the viral lifecycle which 477 cannot be recapitulated in a standard tissue culture system (39).", "tokens": ["copyright_holder", "holder_preprint", "preprint_peerreviewe", "peerreviewe_httpsdoiorg10110120200110901801", "httpsdoiorg10110120200110901801_doi", "doi_bioRxiv", "bioRxiv_preprint", "preprint_copy", "copy_PK1", "PK1_PK4", "PK4_observation", "observation_consistent", "consistent_previous", "previous_report", "report_deletion", "deletion_PK1", "PK1_PolyCtract", "PolyCtract_adverse", "adverse_effect", "effect_viral", "viral_replication", "replication_support", "support_finding", "finding_truncation", "truncation_PolyCtract", "PolyCtract_create", "create_C11", "C11_construct", "construct_effect", "effect_replicon", "replicon_replication", "replication_cell", "cell_line", "line_test", "test_describe", "describe_Mengo", "Mengo_virus", "virus_possible", "possible_role", "role_polyctract", "polyctract_essential", "essential_aspect", "aspect_viral", "viral_lifecycle", "lifecycle_recapitulate", "recapitulate_standard", "standard_tissue", "tissue_culture", "culture_system"]}
