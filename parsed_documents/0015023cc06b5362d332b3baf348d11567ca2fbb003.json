The first 360 nucleotides at the 5\u2032 72 end are predicted to fold into a single large stem loop termed the S-fragment, followed by a The PKs were originally predicted in 1987 and consist of two to four tandem repeats of a ~48 86 nucleotide region containing a small stem loop and downstream interaction site (figure 1B) 87 (12). Due to the sequence similarity between the PKs (figure 1C), it is speculated that they 88 were formed by duplication events during viral replication, probably involving recombination. 89 Between two and four PKs are present in different virus isolates but no strain has been 90 identified with less than two PKs, emphasising their potential importance in the viral life cycle 91 (19, 20) .

Although replicons and full-length genomes lacking PKs were 106 replication-competent, no infectious virus was rescued from genomes containing less than one 107 PK copy. This is consistent with our earlier report describing the presence of putative 108 packaging signals in the PK region (22). 109 110 author/funder. All rights reserved.
