The 5\u2032 UTR of FMDV is unique amongst picornaviruses due to its large size and the presence 454 of multiple RNA elements, some of which still have unknown function. One of these features 455 is a series of repeated PKs varying in number from 2-4, depending on virus strain. In this study, 456 we sequentially deleted or mutated the PKs to help understand their role in the viral life cycle. 457 We also confirmed the predicted PK structures by SHAPE mapping, although there may be Although all viruses isolated to date contain at least two PKs, replicons or viruses containing a 464 single PK were still replication competent. However, replicons with more than a single PK 465 were found to have a competitive advantage over replicons with a single PK when sequentially 466 passaged. Replicons lacking all PKs displayed poor passaging potential even when co-467 transfected with yeast tRNA, reinforcing the observation of a significant impact in replication.", "tokens": ["copyright_holder", "holder_preprint", "preprint_peerreviewe", "peerreviewe_httpsdoiorg10110120200110901801", "httpsdoiorg10110120200110901801_doi", "doi_bioRxiv", "bioRxiv_preprint", "preprint_passage", "passage_figure", "figure_5b", "5b_appear", "appear_replicon", "replicon_single", "single_pk", "pk_competitive", "competitive_disadvantage", "disadvantage_compare", "compare_copyright", "copyright_holder", "holder_preprint", "preprint_peerreviewe", "peerreviewe_httpsdoiorg10110120200110901801", "httpsdoiorg10110120200110901801_doi", "doi_bioRxiv", "bioRxiv_preprint", "preprint_infectious", "infectious_virus", "virus_despite", "despite_able", "able_replicate", "replicate_transfection", "transfection_cell", "cell_consistent", "consistent_requirement", "requirement_RNA", "RNA_structure", "structure_PK", "PK_region", "region_require", "require_virus", "virus_assembly", "assembly_UTR", "UTR_FMDV", "FMDV_unique", "unique_picornavirus", "picornavirus_large", "large_size", "size_presence", "presence_multiple", "multiple_RNA", "RNA_element", "element_unknown", "unknown_function", "function_feature", "feature_series", "series_repeat", "repeat_pk", "pk_varying", "varying_number", "number_depend", "depend_virus", "virus_strain", "strain_study", "study_sequentially", "sequentially_delete", "delete_mutate", "mutate_pk", "pk_help", "help_understand", "understand_role", "role_viral", "viral_life", "life_cycle", "cycle_confirm", "confirm_predicted", "predicted_PK", "PK_structure", "structure_shape", "shape_mapping", "mapping_virus", "virus_isolate", "isolate_date", "date_contain", "contain_pk", "pk_replicon", "replicon_virus", "virus_contain", "contain_single", "single_PK", "PK_replication", "replication_competent", "competent_replicon", "replicon_single", "single_PK", "PK_find", "find_competitive", "competitive_advantage", "advantage_replicon", "replicon_single", "single_PK", "PK_sequentially", "sequentially_passage", "passage_replicon", "replicon_lack", "lack_pk", "pk_display", "display_poor", "poor_passage", "passage_potential", "potential_co467", "co467_transfected", "transfected_yeast", "yeast_tRNA", "tRNA_reinforce", "reinforce_observation", "observation_significant", "significant_impact", "impact_replication"]}
