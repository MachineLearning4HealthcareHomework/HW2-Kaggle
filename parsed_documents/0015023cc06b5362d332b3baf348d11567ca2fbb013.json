As near wt level of 353 replication was observed when only one PK was present, all further mutagenesis was 354 performed in a C11 replicon plasmid containing only PK 1. In addition, the orientation of PK 1 was reversed by \"flipping\" the nucleotide sequence to 367 potentially facilitate hybridisation of the loop with upstream rather than downstream sequences.", "tokens": ["orientation_removal", "removal_pk", "pk_result", "result_significant", "significant_decrease", "decrease_replication", "replication_minimal", "minimal_requirement", "requirement_maintain", "maintain_wt", "wt_level", "level_replication", "replication_investigate", "investigate_near", "near_wt", "wt_level", "level_replication", "replication_observe", "observe_pk", "pk_present", "present_mutagenesis", "mutagenesis_perform", "perform_C11", "C11_replicon", "replicon_plasmid", "plasmid_contain", "contain_PK", "PK_addition", "addition_orientation", "orientation_PK", "PK_reverse", "reverse_flip", "flip_nucleotide", "nucleotide_sequence", "sequence_potentially", "potentially_facilitate", "facilitate_hybridisation", "hybridisation_loop", "loop_upstream", "upstream_downstream", "downstream_sequence"]}
