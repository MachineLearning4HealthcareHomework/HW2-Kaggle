Abstract 27 The positive stranded RNA genomes of picornaviruses comprise a single large open reading 28 frame flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs). Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 29 has an unusually large 5\u2032 UTR (1.3 kb) containing five structural domains. These include the 30 internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which facilitates initiation of translation, and the cis-acting 31 replication element (cre). Less well characterised structures are a 5\u2032 terminal 360 nucleotide 32 stem-loop, a variable length poly-C-tract of approximately 100-200 nucleotides and a series of 33 two to four tandemly repeated pseudoknots (PKs). We investigated the structures of the PKs 34 by selective 2\u2032 hydroxyl acetylation analysed by primer extension (SHAPE) analysis and 35 determined their contribution to genome replication by mutation and deletion experiments. 36 SHAPE and mutation experiments confirmed the importance of the previously predicted PK 37 structures for their function. Deletion experiments showed that although PKs are not essential 38"}
