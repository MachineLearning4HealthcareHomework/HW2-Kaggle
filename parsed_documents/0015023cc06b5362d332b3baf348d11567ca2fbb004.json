PKs 3 and 4 were removed by digestion with HindIII and AatII 123 before insertion of a synthetic DNA sequence with PK 3 and 4 deleted. PKs 2, 3 and 4 were 124 deleted by PCR amplification using \u0394PK 234 Forward primer and FMDV 1331-1311 reverse 125 primer, the resultant product was digested with HindIII and AatII and ligated into the 126 pBluescript PK vector. Complete PK deletion was achieved by introduction of an AflII site at 127 the 3\u2032 end of the poly-C tract by PCR mutagenesis to create the sub-cloning vector, pBluescript 128 C11, which was then used to remove all the PKs by PCR mutagenesis using \u0394PK 1234 forward 129 primer and FMDV 1331-1311 reverse primer. The modified PK sequences were removed from 130 the sub-cloning vectors and inserted into the pRep-ptGFP plasmid using NheI-HF and KpnI-131 HF.", "tokens": ["introduce_mutation", "mutation_PK", "PK_region", "region_pRepptGFP", "pRepptGFP_replicon", "replicon_plasmid", "plasmid_digest", "digest_SpeI", "SpeI_KpnI", "KpnI_result", "result_fragment", "fragment_insert", "insert_subclone", "subclone_vector", "vector_pBluescript", "pBluescript_create", "create_pBluescript", "pBluescript_PK", "PK_pk", "pk_remove", "remove_digestion", "digestion_HindIII", "HindIII_AatII", "AatII_insertion", "insertion_synthetic", "synthetic_dna", "dna_sequence", "sequence_PK", "PK_delete", "delete_pk", "pk_delete", "delete_PCR", "PCR_amplification", "amplification_\u0394PK", "\u0394PK_Forward", "Forward_primer", "primer_FMDV", "FMDV_reverse", "reverse_primer", "primer_resultant", "resultant_product", "product_digest", "digest_HindIII", "HindIII_AatII", "AatII_ligate", "ligate_pBluescript", "pBluescript_PK", "PK_vector", "vector_Complete", "Complete_PK", "PK_deletion", "deletion_achieve", "achieve_introduction", "introduction_AflII", "AflII_site", "site_end", "end_polyC", "polyC_tract", "tract_PCR", "PCR_mutagenesis", "mutagenesis_create", "create_subclone", "subclone_vector", "vector_pBluescript", "pBluescript_C11", "C11_remove", "remove_pk", "pk_PCR", "PCR_mutagenesis", "mutagenesis_\u0394PK", "\u0394PK_forward", "forward_primer", "primer_FMDV", "FMDV_reverse", "reverse_primer", "primer_modified", "modified_pk", "pk_sequence", "sequence_remove", "remove_subclone", "subclone_vector", "vector_insert", "insert_prepptgfp", "prepptgfp_plasmid", "plasmid_nheihf", "nheihf_KpnI131", "KpnI131_HF"]}
